Installation of a review candidate
==================================

1) Download the .zip distribution file. Move it to, say, /temp, and unzip it there.
   That will result in a directory in /temp named endian-rc#, where # is the number of the
   review candidate.

2) If you haven't already done so, install a current version of Boost. 
   Since Boost.Endian is a header only library, there is no need to run a build.
   
3) Copy the endian files to your Boost installation (replace MY-BOOST with its path):

    Windows:  xcopy /s /i \temp\endian-rc#\* MY-BOOST   
    POSIX:    cp -r /temp/endian-rc#/* MY-BOOST
	
4) Run the tests (as a confidence builder that the install went OK):

       cd MY-BOOST/endian/libs/endian/test
       bjam
