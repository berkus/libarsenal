=======

Support tools, classes and templates for C++17 projects.

This is a very small library of classes that are reused between several projects and do not find their place anywhere in the bigger frameworks.

* algorithm - extended algorithms,
* any_int_cast - cast integer `boost::any` to integer type regardless of exact storage type,
* base32 - conversion between byte arrays and base32-encoded strings,
* base32x - conversion between byte arrays and base32x-encoded strings,
* base64 - conversion between byte arrays and base64-encoded strings,
* proquint - conversion between byte arrays and proquint-encoded strings,
* byte_array - a convenient wrapper around `vector<char>`,
* flurry - msgpackv5-based (de-)serialization,
* stdext::hash_combine - implements `hash_combine` which didn't make its way into the stdlib,
* logging - flexible lightweight logging,
* pubqueue - C++ trick to access underlying container of `std::queue`,
* settings_provider - a settings storage class abstracting platform-specific details,
* underlying - convert an enum class type to its underlying storage type.
